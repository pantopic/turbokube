Surprises:
  etcd:
    - Network bandwidth is higher than expected
    - CPU usage in relation to other metrics is lower than expected
    - Memory usage is way lower than expected (under 0.5 GB out of 16)
  api-server:
    - Memory usage is about half of expected (4 GB out of 16)
  scheduler: 
    - |
      The turbokube scheduler is really bad at assigning pods to underutilized nodes. The entire process stalled many
      times after autoscale because the scheduler assigned new pods to older nodes even when there were new nodes
      with relatively few pods assigned. Maybe the lack of resource requests is breaking the scheduler algorithm and
      we need to request some minimum amount of memory in order for balance to occur?

Not surprises:
  leases:
    - Renewal throughput grows linearly (as suspected)
